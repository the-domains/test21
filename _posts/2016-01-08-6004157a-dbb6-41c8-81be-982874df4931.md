The English town of Northampton was once the shoemaking capital of Europe, with 2,000 individual bootmakers working there towards the end of the nineteenth century. The town's central position and proximity to the eleven rivers running through the county made Northampton an obvious place for cobblers to set up business.

Andrew Loake, Managing Director of Loake, says: "There was a leather industry in Northamptonshire long before there was a shoe trade here. Our understanding is that there were plentiful oak forests in the county and oak bark was used for tanning leather. So it was a natural progression for the shoe trade to develop in the same area."

The subsequent availability of leather and Northampton's strategic importance led to it becoming a centre of military bootmaking, with demand soaring due to the Napoleonic Wars of the late eighteenth and.   
This demand has thankfully returned. Stephen Johnson, Site Director of John Lobb, says: "We established our factory in Oliver Street, Northampton in 1993, but demand has increased dramatically to the point that we are now producing over 30,000 pairs a year -- and that means we have had to expand the premises."

The expansion means John Lobb can take on further staff, which will bring the total workers employed in their Northampton factory to over 100\. Production will expand steadily to around 40,000 pairs a year.
